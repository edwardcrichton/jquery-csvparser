jquery-csvparser
================

A jQuery plugin that will parse CSV text into an array of arrays.
This does not use split() or regular expressions. Instead it parses the text so that commas, newlines and escaped quotes work
as expected and you may use different separators and quotes. For example, it could be used to read tab separated values files.

To learn how to use it, see the [wiki](https://github.com/edwardcrichton/jquery-csvparser/wiki) .

At some point I might add a CSV writer, so that it might be used to create csv files.
